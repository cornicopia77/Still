If I put an hour of coding for 2 months, I'd be able to code the whole framework for the beta version.

Conceptualize: Develop a game concept, including its genre, theme, and core gameplay mechanics. 


This is a game where numbers, users pictures or inputs, start building the users game profile. 

The genre of the game is building.

The theme of the game is finding the treasure.
The core gameplay mechanics of the game, agree to user building around their listed tribes where they must build up and try to be the first 100 users to get to the treasures. When they are able to get there. Multiple users playing at once, would not be known to user, until the user was challenged. 

This game can be played multiple times, and can take users preference on building each gameplay which is an input. It'd be nice to have a storage facility offered to the user, during gameplay so that they don't have to submit until wanted.

There's quests along the way, users follow a storyline through the entire completion.
